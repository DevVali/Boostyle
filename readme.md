# Boostyle

Boost your CSS styles with Boostyle.

## Use

Include the script into head.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://devvali.github.io/Boostyle/index.css">
```

Or for better experience, you can only use the styles you need.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://devvali.github.io/Boostyle/buttons.css">
```

## Collections

Collections allow you to use only the styles you need for your project.

For example, you need a component for a button. You simply get the button's collection.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://devvali.github.io/Boostyle/buttons.css">
```

You can find the full list of collections available [here](https://github.com/DevVali/Boostyle/tree/main/collections).
